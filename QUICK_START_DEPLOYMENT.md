npm install
npm run build
```

### Port error
- Vercel automatically sets `PORT=3000`
- No action needed, it's already configured

### Products not showing after deployment
- This is normal - data resets on deployment
- Products are stored in memory
- For persistent data, add a database (see full guide)

### Admin login not working
- Check credentials: `promax` / `promax@69`
- Clear browser cache and try again
